## ANTI-SCRAPING MEASURES SUMMARY

### Findings from Web Search Research (2024-2025):

1. **Cloudflare Protection:**
   - Many news sites use Cloudflare for bot management
   - Cloudflare introduced AI crawler blocking in September 2024
   - Over 1 million sites now block AI crawlers by default
   - Major publishers supporting Cloudflare's permission-based model:
     * Associated Press, The Atlantic, BuzzFeed, Condé Nast
     * Fortune, Gannett/USA TODAY Network, Sky News, Time

2. **Paywalls:**
   - NYT, WaPo, WSJ, LA Times, Chicago Tribune have paywalls
   - Most allow listing page access but restrict article content
   - Some (WSJ) have stricter access controls (401 errors)

3. **Bot Blocking Statistics:**
   - 88% of top US news outlets block AI data collection bots
   - Right-wing media sites less likely to block AI crawlers
   - Fox News, Breitbart, Daily Caller typically don't block bots

4. **Rate Limiting:**
   - Common on major news sites
   - May trigger after multiple rapid requests
