I am developing an open-source US news monitoring and analysis system that tracks political, economic, and military news from 199 RSS sources. 

The application uses machine learning to cluster related news articles and detect emerging hotspots. I need FRED API access to enhance the analysis by correlating news events with real-time economic indicators such as:
- Federal Funds Rate (for Fed policy news verification)
- Consumer Price Index/CPI (for inflation-related news)
- Unemployment Rate (for labor market analysis)
- GDP growth data

The integration will help validate economic news accuracy and provide contextual economic background when detecting signals from financial news sources like Bloomberg, WSJ, and Reuters.

This is a non-commercial research project for educational and information monitoring purposes only. I will respect the 120 requests/minute rate limit and use the data responsibly.
